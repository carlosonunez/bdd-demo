# A Simple BDD Demo

This is a demo that I compiled for LinkedIn Learning.

Super simple five minute demo of BDD with Cucumber and Ruby!

# How To Run

1. Bring everything up (in the background): `docker-compose up -d`
2. Run cucumber: `docker-compose run --rm cucumber`
3. If you're presenting, the slides are available at http://localhost/slides.md#
4. You can see the browser by opening your favorite VNC client (e.g. "Screen Sharing" on MacOS) and
   opening `localhost:5950`. The password is "secret".
